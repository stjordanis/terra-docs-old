Welcome to the official Terra documentation.

## What is Terra?

Put simply, Terra is a new cryptocurrency that is:

* **price-stable** through an an algorithmically-enforced elastic monetary policy

* **decentralized** meaning it isn't tied to one government's currency like Tether or TrueUSD, and retains all of the censorship resistance of Bitcoin

* **focused on user-adoption and growth**, and is already being used by thousands of retail consumers throughout Korea and Southeast Asia.
