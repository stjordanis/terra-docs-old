Welcome to the official Terra documentation. Terra is currently running [**Columbus-3 Mainnet**](columbus3.md), the latest iteration of the network which brings many new features and breaking changes, requiring a hard fork. Please read up there to keep up-to-date.

## What is Terra?

Put simply, Terra is a new cryptocurrency that is:

* **price-stable** through an algorithmically-enforced elastic monetary policy that pivots miner incentives toward stable, consistent growth.

* **decentralized** meaning it isn't tied to one government's currency like Tether or TrueUSD, and retains all of the censorship resistance of Bitcoin

* **focused on user-adoption and growth**, and is already being used by thousands of retail consumers throughout Korea and Southeast Asia.

## Documentation Overview

- [**Terra Protocol**](dev-how-terra-works.md) presents a technical specifcation of the Terra decentralized stablecoin system, explaining the mechanisms behind its core features through its reference implementation written in Golang, Terra Core.

- [**User Manual**](node-installation.md) covers how to interact with the Terra blockchain and participate in the network either as simply a user or a validator by running Terra Core, the official node software.

- [**Validator Handbook**](validator-intro.md) is a collection of helpful information, troubleshooting recipes, and best practices we've compiled for validators.

- [**Contribute**](contribute-contributing.md) outlines the community effort for improving Terra, including guidelines for contributing to Terra Core and for submitting Terra Improvement Proposals (TIPs).
