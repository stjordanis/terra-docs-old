Welcome to the official Terra documentation.

- [**Terra Protocol**]() presents a high-level overview of how the Terra decentralized stablecoin works, and mechanisms. Start here if you are new to Terra.

- [**User Manual**]() covers how to interact with the Terra blockchain and participate in the network either as simply a user or a validator by running Terra Core, the official node software.

- [**Validator Handbook**]() is a collection of helpful information, troubleshooting recipes, and best practices we've compiled for validators.

- [**Developer Guide**]() is a technical reference for both blockchain developers working with the Terra Core codebase and for third-party application developers wanting to integrate with Terra.

- [**Contribute**]() outlines the community effort for improving Terra, including guidelines for contributing to Terra Core and for submitting Terra Improvement Proposals (TIPs).
