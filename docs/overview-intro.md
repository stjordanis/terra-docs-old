Welcome to the official Terra Documentation. Since Terra is a large project and can be intimidating to approach, we've organized articles into the following sections:

* [**Terra Protocol**](proto-what-is-terra.md) explains how Terra works. Start here if you want to understand fundamentals about its blockchain architecture such as consensus and staking, and the mechanisms behind achieving stability and ensuring long-term growth.

* [**Node Software**](node-installation.md) describes how to run a full node to be a part of the Terra network or a testnet, for both validators and non-validators.

* [**Validator Guide**](validator-validator-intro.md) provides more in-depth treatment for how to run a validator node, and outlines important responsibilities and helpful guidelines.

* [**Developer Guide**](dev-getting-started.md) is for developers who want to familiarize themselves with Terra Core codebase or write third-party software that integrates with the Terra blockchain.

* [**Contribute**](contribute-contributing.md) gives guidelines on how to contribute to the Terra project.
