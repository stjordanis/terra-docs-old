title: Getting involved with Terra
---

This document lays out several ways in which you can contribute to the Terra project.

## Contribute to Terra Core

[Terra Core](https://github.com/terra-project/core) is the official site of development for the node software implementation, and thus the site where the Terra Protocol is developed and maintained. Contributing to Terra Core means contributing directly to the development of the Terra blockchain.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

When you are not sure of who the code owner is, please email the Terra Core dev team at core@terra.money. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

### Pull Request Process

Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.

Update the `README.md` with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.

Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the `README.md` to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer.

You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Get involved with research

Terra is a stablecoin project that is first-of-its-kind in terms of scale and adoption. The Terra team thus devotes a lot of effort in scoping out the frontier and rigorously testing bleeding-edge models and prototypes to ensure a reliable experience for the tens of thousands of users on platforms powered by Terra.

The best way to get up to speed regarding research is to read up on the latest developments on [Agora](https://agora.terra.money/), our official forum for research. You can also check out our models and simulations on our research repository on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/terra-project/research).



### Open research problems

You can find a list of open research problems [here](https://github.com/terra-project/research/wiki/Problems). 

### Research grant opportunities

We are currently seeking high-value research proposals, available for grant funding from the Community Pool. Please connect with us at core@terra.money if you have a proposal for a research project that helps Terra development -- we may be willing to help you fund it!

## Help translate

Terra is an open source Blockchain framework that is meant to be used by developers around the world. We need your help to make this website more friendly for developers of all languages.

If you can help translate the documentation here into another language, please go to Crowdin and pick a language to get started.

Once your translation gets approved, it will appear on this website!

If you are interested in approving translations from others, please send an email to core@terra.money.
